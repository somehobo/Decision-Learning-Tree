# Decision-Tree-Learning
## Decision Learning tree, implemented using the CART algorithm

Decision Tree Learning refers to predictive modeling algorithms that form trees to make predictions. For this project I focused on the CART or Classification and 
Regression Tree algorithm, which has been hugely popular for decades.  The cart algorithm forms a tree from test data, at the aim of predicting classification 
values (can only be two different values,) for a given row of data.
